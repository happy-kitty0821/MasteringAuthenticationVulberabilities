# Question:  

## **Lab: Username enumeration via different responses**
This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:

[Candidate usernames](./usernames) <br>
[Candidate passwords](./passwords) <br>
To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.
