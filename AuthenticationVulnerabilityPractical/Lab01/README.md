# Question:  

## **Lab: Username enumeration via different responses**
This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:

[Candidate usernames](./usernames) <br>
[Candidate passwords](./passwords) <br>

To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

### **The lab is hosted at ["portswigger-lab"](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/password-based/lab-username-enumeration-via-different-responses)**
